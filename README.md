# Java-Sample-Problems

Like all people, I forget when I'm not in touch with the subjects. In the past few months, I've been keen on landing a job that I almost forgot the basics.

I've learnt some things in the meanwhile.
- Degree does matter. (Not only skills)
- Don't concentrate on a single thing. Spend equal time on everyting / everyone. Be it work - family or Job search - Developing skills.
- Luck plays a major part in daily life.

This is an effort to get back to the basics of Java programming.
